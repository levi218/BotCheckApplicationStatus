Made the bot while waiting for the application form to be accepted.

Discovered later that I'd receive an email anyway when the status on the site changed.

So this bot doesnt help much, just a little project to myself, learned about HtmlAgilityPack and the basic requirement to create a crawling bot.

Usage:
1. Put in the registration number, email, and the interval you want the app to update the status in minute
2. Press config, the application will save the config for next use and close the window, continue to run in background.
Note: 
- If you want the app to run when Windows started, create a shortcut to the app .exe file and put it in Windows' startup folder.
- If you want to stop the app, use task manager, this was a personal tool, I didnt need a context menu to close it.
